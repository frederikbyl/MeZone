		You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

		  /home/frederik/Development/Projects/MeZone/MeZone

		? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Database: Deploy Firebase Realtim
		e Database Rules, Firestore: Deploy rules and create indexes for Firestore, Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

		=== Project Setup

		First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
		You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
		but for now we'll just set up a default project.

		? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: MeZone (mezone-a1abe)

		=== Database Setup

		Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
		structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

		? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
		✔  Database Rules for mezone-a1abe have been downloaded to database.rules.json.
		Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run
		firebase deploy.

		=== Firestore Setup

		Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
		requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
		and publish them with firebase deploy.

		? What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules

		Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
		maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
		set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
		and publish them with firebase deploy.

		? What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json

		=== Hosting Setup

		Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
		will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
		have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

		? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
		? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
		✔  Wrote public/404.html
		✔  Wrote public/index.html

		i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
